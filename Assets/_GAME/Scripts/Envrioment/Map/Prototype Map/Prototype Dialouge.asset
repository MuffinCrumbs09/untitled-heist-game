  - This is just... a folder full of squirrel pictures. Just... hundreds of them.
    Why? ...Anyway, wrong computer.
  - Hm. A list of high-value client accounts. Not our target, but... interesting.
  - Okay, I'm in. And... it's a 200-page PDF titled 'Project Synergistic Leverage'.
    It's all buzzwords. My brain is melting. Keep looking.
  - This guy's search history... 'how to get away with stealing office supplies',
    'easy casserole recipes', 'am I a sociopath quiz'. What a goldmine.
  - Seriously? Their password for this workstation is 'Password123'? These guys are
    begging to be robbed.
  - This is a log of all door access. Looks like the Head of Security always swipes
    his card twice.
  - This PC has a lot of links to... conspiracy theory sites. 'Are banks run by lizard
    people?'
  - Checking their employee reviews... Ah, this one says, 'Mark is a great team player,
    but he needs to work on not giggling at the money counter.'
  - A strongly world email from HR about not taking a dump in the urinal.
